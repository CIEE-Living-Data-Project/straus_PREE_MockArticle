# Introduction

*Baetis* spp, belonging to the insect order Ephemeroptera, are commonly used as stream quality indicators [@wallace1986response].

# Methods

Researchers collected data on the number of *Baetis* spp. per square meter in the benthic environment of various catchments from 1995 to 2005. Some of the catchments were harvested, while others were not.

# Results

Figure \ref{fig1} is generated using an R chunk.

## catchments 31, 33, and 34 were the ones that experienced forest harvest, create new column
dat <- dat %>% mutate(harvest = if_else(catchment == "33" | catchment == "34L" | catchment == "34M" | 
                                   catchment == "34U", true = "yes", false = "no"))

table(dat$harvest)

# for the purposes of this mock assignment, let's just stick on with one genus: Baetis (a genus of mayfly, the order of which are stream quality indicators 
head(dat)
baetis <- dat %>% select(catchment, year, month, replicate, Baetis, harvest)

baetis.sum <- baetis %>% group_by(catchment, year, month, harvest) %>% summarize(mean.dens = mean(Baetis))


## need date format to plot as a time series
table(baetis.sum$month)
baetis.sum <- baetis.sum %>% mutate(month2 = if_else(month == "june", "06", if_else(month == "may", "05", 
                      if_else(month == "november", "11", if_else(month =="october", "10",
                      if_else(month == "september", "09", "0"))))))

# unite month and year
baetis.sum <- baetis.sum %>% unite(col = "year.month", year, month2, sep = "-")

## adding a day to get into yyyy-mm-dd format that R likes, the data file does not specify the day, so we're just going to use the first of the month

baetis.sum <- baetis.sum %>% mutate(ymd = as.Date(paste(year.month,"-01",sep="")))

## double check that are actually in a date format
str(baetis.sum$ymd) # nice!

# check out distribution

# Discussion

Benthic invertebrates are commonly used as indicators of stream water quality [@guilpart2012use]. *Baetis* sp. (Ephemeroptera) are used as stream quality indicators for catchments [@wallace1986response].
